# 2D-Maze-Solver

This program involves importing text files with prefilled mazes made up of unique symbols. The program also consists of automating a route
which always reaches the end of the maze. The features used in order to make this happen incorporate applied object oriented programming concepts. 
These concepts include inheritance, class, and object handling. Data structures such as a linked list of pointers in the form of a struct object 
processes a route and allocated memory dynamically as needed. This allows for backtracking when hit with a deadend and searching until an end is found.
